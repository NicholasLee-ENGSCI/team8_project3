team 8, project 3

Why? - What is the problem? Who are the stakeholders and what do they want? what outcomes of the resource consent are possible?

The internal pressure of the Waikate geothermal field is slowly recovering thanks to a moratorium imposed by local council. Production has decreased, reinjection has increased and pressures are stabilizing and even slowly recovering, so the problem is how to manage this recovering natural resource going into the future. 


How? - Try to identify why and how a computer model could be useful. 


Given? - What data has been given? What data do you think you will need to look up? 


Assume? - conceptual model.

Initial Conditions:

Control Volume: Model with reservoir, water level.
Physical tings:
Conservation of mass/heat/darcy's law
darcy's law defines how water and steam move underground, will need to research more top fully understand this.

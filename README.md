Why? - What is the problem? Who are the stakeholders and what do they want? what outcomes of the resource consent are possible?

The internal pressure of the Waikate geothermal field is slowly recovering thanks to a moratorium imposed by local council. Production has decreased, reinjection has increased and pressures are stabilizing and even slowly recovering, so the problem is how to manage this recovering natural resource going into the future. 

Stakeholders include the Rotorua City Council, who want to extend the moratorium as it is, the local iwi (Tuhourangi Ngati Wahiao), who want a permanent stop to all boreholes, and the local chamber of commerce representing tourism, who want more boreholes re-opened to install geothermally heated baths.

The three options for resource consent are to maintain the current moratorium, stop extracting from all boreholes, or relax the constraints of the moratorium or even remove the moratorium altogether.


How? - Try to identify why and how a computer model could be useful. 

Using the historical data we can model how each of these different solutions would effect the health of the geothermal field, namely the heat and water level. 
These models could then be used to make an informed decision on which solution is best for the health of geothermal well


Given? - What data has been given? What data do you think you will need to look up? 

We have been given data recording the water level and temperature of boreholes since the 1950. However we’re missing data on the water level before the closure program began. This is important in order for us to accurately predict what these water levels might look like in the future when, potentially, the program is no longer running. We need a reference point of levels before overproduction occurred.

We also don’t have data on re-injection rate, but it is important to find a correlation between this and the health of the field in order to recommend a model. Pressure data is also not given but can potentially be inferred from temperature data.


Assume? - conceptual model.

Initial Conditions:

Control Volume: Model with reservoir, water level, in Whakarewarewa region. 
Physical tings:
underlying physics laws are Conservation of mass/heat/darcy's law
darcy's law defines how water and steam move underground, will need to research more top fully understand this.

plot of the data also shows that the production rate is inversely proportional to temperature for time domain before the borehole closure program began in 1986. after production rate stabilised, water level and water level increased.

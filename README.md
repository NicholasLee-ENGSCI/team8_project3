Why? - What is the problem? Who are the stakeholders and what do they want? what outcomes of the resource consent are possible?

The internal pressure of the Waikate geothermal field is slowly recovering thanks to a moratorium imposed by local council. Production has decreased, reinjection has increased and pressures are stabilizing and even slowly recovering, so the problem is how to manage this recovering natural resource going into the future. 


How? - Try to identify why and how a computer model could be useful. 


Given? - What data has been given? What data do you think you will need to look up? 
We have been given data recording the water level and temperature of boreholes since the 1950. However we’re missing data on the water level before the closure program began. This is important in order for us to accurately predict what these water levels might look like in the future when, potentially, the program is no longer running. We need a reference point of levels before overproduction occurred.
We also don’t have data on re-injection rate, but it is important to find a correlation between this and the health of the field in order to recommend a model. Pressure data is also not given but the trend of pressure can potentially be inferred from temperature data.



Assume? - conceptual model.
